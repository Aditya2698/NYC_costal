Here is the description of the modified NYC environment:

The primary contribution of the new study will be that it considers system effects by considering the boroughs of New York, modeling each as a component, considering system interactions to be based on real-life dependence/connection between the boroughs. 

Each sub-system/component will be defined by a wedge. The exact details describing the wedge (Cost, dimensions etc.) will be defined later. 

First we describe the state, action and reward formulation at the component level (section A below). We then describe the component details in Section B and finally describe the system effects in Section C which consideres system interection by modifying the corresponding flooding rewards.

A) Wedge component defination: State, action and reward for individual component:

Each component (wedge) will have 2 possible dynamic actions combinations and can be define by one of the following 4 enviroment defination:

   i) Two floodwall F1 and F2: This is the same as the original environment in single_wedge_2_dike_environment.py)
   ii) Green_space and floodwall F: The environment is defined in the MATLAB code Green_space_and_dike.m
   iii) Oyster reef and floodwall F: defined in Oyster_Reef_and_dike.m: The environment is defined in the MATLAB code Oyster_Reef_and_dike.m
   iv) Salt marsh and floodwall F: The environment is defined in the MATLAB code Salt_Marsh_and_dike.m

ii, iii, and iv are nature based solutions and the major difference with i is that we have a green_space, oyster reef, or salt marsh in the wedge in place of the lower floodwall F1.

Despite these differences, the cost calculations for each component/subsystem would involve the following cost components:

1. Cost of construction:
 - Costs for constructing floodwalls/nature based solutions 

2. Flood Damage Costs:
 - Depend on the flooded volume and vulnerability of the component.
 - C_f(s) = f_damage * V_zone * (V_flooded / V_zone), where f_damage is the flood vulnerability factor.
 - Based on the 2 actions, each component will have 4 system configuration/states (next_system). The corresponding flood damage cost need to be defined for each of the environment defination.

3. Maintenance Costs:
 - Annual costs for maintaining constructed flood protection assets.

4. Environmental cost of carbon:
 - Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are translated into monetary costs using the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).
 - GHG emissions are calculated for construction and maintenance costs
 - In case the component has green infrastructure, it will absorb the carbon released in the atmosphere based on its capacity. This will reduce the GHG emissions and the corresponding costs.	


As the first step, let's define the python code for the cost calculations for the 4 environment defination.

B) Component Details and Parameters:
--------------------------------

The NYC environment consists of 5 components representing different boroughs/regions:

1. Bronx (Component 1): Define using component defination i i.e. two floodwalls F1 and F2
   - Exposure value (e): 2.5 million $/m width
   - Vulnerability factor (f_damage): 0.07
   - City height (h): 9.75 m
   - City depth (d): 6.5 km
   - Slope (s): 9.75/(6.5*1000) = 0.0015
   - Optional features: None

2. Manhattan (Component 2): Define using component defination ii i.e. green_space and floodwall F with initial seawall height of 1.5 m
   - Exposure value (e): 15.3 million $/m width
   - Vulnerability factor (f_damage): 0.07
   - City height (h): 8.5 m
   - City depth (d): 1.0 km
   - Slope (s): 8.5/(1*1000) = 0.0085
   

3. Brooklyn (Component 3): Define using component defination i i.e. two floodwalls F1 and F2
   - Exposure value (e): 4.5 million $/m width
   - Vulnerability factor (f_damage): 0.07
   - City height (h): 13.7 m
   - City depth (d): 5.6 km
   - Slope (s): 13.7/(5.6*1000) = 0.00244643


4. Queens (Component 4): Define using component defination iii i.e. oyster reef and floodwall F.
   - Exposure value (e): 5.5 million $/m width
   - Vulnerability factor (f_damage): 0.07
   - City height (h): 19.8 m
   - City depth (d): 8.85 km
   - Slope (s): 19.8/(8.85*1000) = 0.00223729

5. Staten Island (Component 5): Define using component defination iv i.e. salt marsh and floodwall F.
   - Exposure value (e): 3.0 million $/m width
   - Vulnerability factor (f_damage): 0.07
   - City height (h): 15.24 m
   - City depth (d): 8.0 km
   - Slope (s): 15.24/(8*1000) = 0.001905


--------------------------------
C) System effects and interactions:
--------------------------------

All the above calculations are done at the component level. The system level effects because of interaction/dependence between 2 component would primarily be considered through flooding in adjacent regions. 

The following component pairs have system interactions:

1. Brooklyn-Bronx: Shared infrastructure

2. Bronx-Manhattan: Shared infrastructure

3. Manhattan Upper-Lower: Adjacent regions with shared flood pathway

4. Manhattan-Brooklyn: Shared infrastructure

5. Brooklyn-Queens: Adjacent regions with shared flood pathway through Jamica Bay

6. Staten Island-Brooklyn: Shared infrastructure


The system intereaction is defined as follows: If lower floodwall is not constructed in adjacent region, flood damage in current region increases by a fixed percentage i% (e.g. 20%). 
For component configuration i, the lower floodwall refers to F1 and for all other confiurations with nature based solutions, the lower floodwall refers to F.

For each interacting pair, the flooding reward calculation is to be modified as follows:
- If a floodwall is not constructed in the adjacent region, the flood damage cost (C_f) in the current region is increased by i% (e.g. 20%).
- This represents an i% increase in flood damage due to lateral flooding effects
- The modification needs to consider the slope of the adjacent region. That is the lateral flooding only occurs from region of higher slope to lower slope.

For example:
Consider Manhattan and Brooklyn. Since Manhattan has a higher slope, the lateral flooding only occurs from Manhattan to Brooklyn, the system interaction is defined as follows: 

If Manhattan has no floodwall constructed, the flood damage in Brooklyn increases by i%.
However, if Brooklyn has no floodwall constructed, the flood damage in Manhattan remains the same.


The python code for the cost calculations for the 4 environment defination defined in section A should be able to handle these system effects by:
1. Identifying the adjacent region for each component
2. Checking the floodwall construction status in the adjacent region
3. Applying the i% increase to flood damage costs when conditions are met
