Here is the description of the modified NYC environment:

The primary contribution of the new study will be that it considers system effects by considering the boroughs of New York, modeling each as a component, considering system interactions to be based on real-life dependence/connection between the boroughs. 

Each sub-system/component will be defined by a wedge. The exact details describing the wedge (Cost, dimensions etc.) will be defined later. 

First we describe the state, action and reward formulation at the component level (section A below). We then describe the component details in Section B and finally describe the system effects in Section C which consideres system interection by modifying the corresponding flooding rewards.

A) Wedge component defination: State, action and reward for individual component:

Each component (wedge) will have 2 possible dynamic actions combinations and can be define by one of the following 4 enviroment defination:

   i) Two floodwall F1 and F2: This is the same as the original environment in single_wedge_2_dike_environment.py)
   ii) Green_space and floodwall F: The environment is defined in the MATLAB code Green_space_and_dike.m
   iii) Oyster reef and floodwall F: defined in Oyster_Reef_and_dike.m: The environment is defined in the MATLAB code Oyster_Reef_and_dike.m
   iv) Salt marsh and floodwall F: The environment is defined in the MATLAB code Salt_Marsh_and_dike.m

ii, iii, and iv are nature based solutions and the major difference with i is that we have a green_space, oyster reef, or salt marsh in the wedge in place of the lower floodwall F1.

Despite these differences, the cost calculations for each component/subsystem would involve the following cost components:

1. Cost of construction:
 - Costs for constructing floodwalls/nature based solutions 

2. Flood Damage Costs:
 - Depend on the flooded volume and vulnerability of the component.
 - C_f(s) = f_damage * V_zone * (V_flooded / V_zone), where f_damage is the flood vulnerability factor.
 - Based on the 2 actions, each component will have 4 system configuration/states (next_system). The corresponding flood damage cost need to be defined for each of the environment defination.

3. Maintenance Costs:
 - Annual costs for maintaining constructed flood protection assets.

4. Environmental cost of carbon:
 - Life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are translated into monetary costs using the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).
 - GHG emissions are calculated for construction and maintenance costs
 - In case the component has green infrastructure, it will absorb the carbon released in the atmosphere based on its capacity. This will reduce the GHG emissions and the corresponding costs.	


As the first step, let's define the python code for the cost calculations for the 4 environment defination.

--------------------------------
C) System effects and interactions
--------------------------------

The system interactions are implemented through a simple lateral flooding mechanism between adjacent components. Each component needs to know:
1. Its adjacent components that can affect it
2. The slope relationship with those components

Interaction Pairs (Higher slope → Lower slope):
1. Manhattan (0.0085) → Brooklyn (0.00244643)
2. Manhattan (0.0085) → Bronx (0.00149231)
3. Brooklyn (0.00244643) → Queens (0.00223729)
4. Brooklyn (0.00244643) → Bronx (0.00149231)
5. Brooklyn (0.00244643) → Staten Island (0.001905)

Critical Floodwall Definition:
- Two-floodwall environments (Bronx, Brooklyn): F2 is critical
- Nature-based solution environments (Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island): F is critical

Flooding Effect Rules:
For each interaction pair (A, B):
1. When water height is between base and top of critical floodwall:
   - If A's critical floodwall is NOT constructed:
     * B's flood damage is increased by i%
   - If B's critical floodwall is NOT constructed:
     * A's flood damage is increased by j%
2. No lateral flow occurs if both components have their critical floodwalls constructed
3. Interaction factors i% and j% can be different:
   - i%: Increase in flood damage for lower slope region
   - j%: Increase in flood damage for higher slope region

Implementation Requirements:
1. Each component needs:
   - List of components that can affect it
   - Method to check critical floodwall status
   - Base and top heights of critical floodwall
   - Factors i% and j% for flood damage increase

2. Cost Calculator Changes:
   - Add method to check critical floodwall status
   - Add method to get critical floodwall heights
   - Modify flood damage calculation to accept interaction effects
   - Apply appropriate increase (i% or j%) based on interaction type

3. System State Tracking:
   - Track floodwall construction status for each component
   - Share status with affected components for damage calculations
