Modified NYC Environment Implementation Guide
===============================================

Overview
--------
This guide describes the implementation of the modified NYC flood protection environment where the five boroughs are modeled as individual components. Each component uses its own cost calculator module based on its protection type (two-floodwall, green space, oyster reef, or salt marsh). In addition, system interactions are incorporated by modifying flood damage costs based on adjacent component states and slopes.

Key Points:
- The water level state (derived from SLR and storm surge) is common across all components.
- Each component is tracked separately with its own system state.
- System interactions are applied by increasing the flood damage cost by i% (a generic percentage) for a component if an adjacent (higher-slope) component has not constructed its critical floodwall.
- The cost for each component is broken down into:
    1. Construction cost (monetary and associated carbon cost),
    2. Maintenance cost (monetary and carbon cost),
    3. Flood damage (risk of failure, including carbon cost),
    4. Carbon uptake cost (if applicable).
- All carbon costs from cost calculator methods will be multiplied by the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to convert them into monetary values.
- The overall reward is the aggregation of all component costs (including adjustments from system interactions), and a separate record of rewards is maintained for each component.

Implementation Steps
--------------------

1. **Component Initialization and Parameter Setup**
   - For each of the 5 NYC components (Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island):
     - Define local parameters (exposure value, slope, vulnerability factor, city height, city depth, etc.) as described in Section B of the NYC_environment_description.txt file.
     - Instantiate the appropriate cost calculator module:
       * Bronx and Brooklyn: TwoFloodwallCosts.py
       * Manhattan: GreenSpaceCosts.py
       * Queens: OysterReefCosts.py
       * Staten Island: SaltMarshCosts.py
     - Initialize a local system state for the component (indicating if the critical floodwall is built).
     - Maintain an action history 

2. **Water Level State Transition**
   - Load and use SLR and storm surge transition matrices (as in single_wedge_2_floodwall_environment.py) to update the water level state for each timestep.
   - The state space for SLR and storm surge is defined in Section 1 of the NYC_environment_description.txt file.
   - The SLR transiton matrix is saved as 't_slr_245.mat' which is a cell 1x131 cell array. Each cell corresponds to the a year an is 77x77 defininng the transition matrix for that year.
   - The storm surge transition matrix is saved as 't_surge.mat' which is a 1x1 cell with a 72x72 matrix defining the transition probabilities for the stationary storm surge.
   - Sample the SLR and storm surge transition matrices at each timestep as done in single_wedge_2_floodwall_environment.py.
   - The resulting water level (total height) is common and available to all components for computing flood damage.

3. **Local Cost Calculation for Each Component**
   - For each component, based on its local system state and the current total water level:
     - Call the cost calculator's appropriate methods to compute:
       * Flood damage cost (including its carbon component),
       * Construction cost (monetary and carbon),
       * Maintenance cost (monetary and carbon),
       * Carbon uptake (if applicable).
     - Multiply all carbon cost components by the current Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) for conversion into monetary terms.
      - The SCC is saved in 'discounted_sum_scc_7_3.mat' is 1x60 vector. Each element corresponds to a year and defining the SCC for that year. Note that SCC already accounts for discounting. So all carbon costs are already discounted.
   - Store these values separately for each component (e.g., in a dictionary or log structure).

4. **System Interaction Handling**
   - System Interaction Implementation:
    1. Initialize interaction parameters:
       - Define i% (higher_to_lower_factor) for increase in flood damage of lower slope region
       - Define j% (lower_to_higher_factor) for increase in flood damage of higher slope region
    
    2. For each interaction pair:
       - Check if water height is between base and top of critical floodwall
       - If either component's critical floodwall is not constructed:
         * Apply i% increase to lower slope region's flood damage
         * Apply j% increase to higher slope region's flood damage
       - No increase if both critical floodwalls are constructed
    
    3. Critical Range Check:
       - Only apply interaction effects when water height is in critical range
       - Critical range is defined by base and top heights of critical floodwall
       - These heights are same for both components in an interaction pair

5. **Reward Aggregation**
   - **Per Component:** Maintain a detailed record including:
     - Construction cost (monetary and carbon cost),
     - Maintenance cost (monetary and carbon cost),
     - Flood risk (flood damage cost) and its carbon cost post system interaction adjustment,
     - Carbon uptake credit (if applicable).
   - Note that monetory cost need to be discounted. The carbon cost is already discounted.
   - **Overall Environment:** Sum the rewards (i.e., costs) from all 5 components to produce an aggregated overall cost.
   

6. **Action Handling and System State History**
   - Define the environment's state and action space as a vector of actions corresponding to a component.
   - For every timestep:
     - Record the action taken for each component.
     - Update the local system state for each component accordingly.
     - Log the current system state for each component; system interactions only require checking the current system state.

7. **System State and Data Logging**
   - In the environment's data structure, maintain:
     - A component-wise reward log (with breakdowns as described).
     - A history of actions and current system state for each component.
     - The common water level state for each timestep.
   - These records will support debugging, analysis, and potential refinement of system interactions.

8. **Final Output from step() Function**
   - The environment's step() function should return:
     - The updated water state (or observation) based on SLR and surge transitions.
     - The aggregated overall reward (total cost), which incorporates individual component costs and system interaction adjustments.
     - An info dictionary containing detailed, component-level reward breakdowns and system state data.

These steps form the blueprint for the modified NYC environment. They ensure that both component-specific and aggregate costs are tracked, that system interactions based on slope and floodwall status are applied using the current state, and that all carbon costs are properly converted to monetary values using the SCC.
